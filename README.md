# Python Playground: A Shipments Company mock

#### Hello, thank you for trying out my playground!
This project is purely based in Django freamework.

The nav bar includes a home button in the logo, a dropdown menu that leads to the user's settings, and the avatar functionality.

Home page is a dashboard with quick access to the 3 main routes: clients, products and shipments (based on the project's models).

Each model's page will display a table that represents my database's entries, with respective crud options.

## Routes are:
- signup, login, logout
- index
- edit profile, update avatar
- clients, client_filter (filter by name)
- products
- shiptments

#### Throught your navigation you will be able to register an account, log into it, edit it's information, update your profile, and complete crud operations over every model.
