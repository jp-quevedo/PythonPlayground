Hello, thank you for trying out my playground!
This project is based on a shipment company mock.
Home page is a dashboard with quick access to the 3 main routes and each route will display a table that represents my database's models.
I've got 3 models: clients, products, and shipments.
Routes are:
- clients, client_form, client_filter (filter by name)
- products, product_form
- shiptments

More details and functionality to come.
