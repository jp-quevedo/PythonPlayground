        <p>Hello, thank you for trying out my playground!</p>
        <p>My name is Juan Pablo Quevedo √Ålvarez and I developed this project purely based in Django freamework.</p>
        <p>My main objective here is to put Django's functionalities to the test and develope a useful application with clean code.</p>
        <p>Throught your navigation you will be able to register an account, log into it, edit it's information, update your profile, and complete crud operations over every model.</p>
